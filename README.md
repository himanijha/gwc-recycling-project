<h2> Compost </h2>
<h3> Why should I care? </h3>
Items in the compost bin break down and avoid going to a landfill. A lot of KMS waste actually belongs here -- trays and other paper food packaging belongs here
 some packaging needs to be separated from the lid or other parts


Any food products or cardboard packaging belongs in the GREEN COMPOST BINS. Items in here break down easier and avoid going to a landfill, which is better for the environment and the air we breathe. Much of KMS waste actually belongs here if sorted correctly, which can save money for our school. -Any type of food scrap such as fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, or grains that will not be eaten belongs in this green compost bins. The stickers on the fruits can also be put in the bins. Paper food packaging such as boxes of raisins or raisels  or the brown lunch trays, or hot lunch containers belong in compost, but the plastic lid or wrapper belongs in recycling.  Even paper goods like napkins, used paper towels, and used tissues can be composted. Any and all food scraps from non-paper food containers should be thrown in the compost.
